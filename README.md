# jio-vertical
Read [https://japanese.io/](japanese.io) texts from top to bottom, right to left.

## Installation
You will need a custom CSS extension (e.g. Stylus) and Tampermonkey (or a fork of it).

**CSS**: Write a new style that applies to all urls beginning with `https://www.japanese.io/classics/`, then copy-paste the code in the extension's editor.

**JS**: Get it from [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/421337-jio-vertical). Alternatively, create a new script and copy-paste the code in the extension's editor.
